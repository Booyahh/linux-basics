## Firewall configuration

 **What is Firewall?**

Firewall is a network security system that filters and controls the traffic on a predetermined set of rules. This is an intermediary system between the device and the internet.

**Chains?**

We have three chains(set of rules) which are used to process the traffic:-

    INPUT Chains => Any traffic coming from the internet(network) towards your local machine has to go through the input chains. 
    OUTPUT Chains => Any traffic going from your local machine to the internet needs to go through the output chains.
    FORWARD Chains => Any traffic which is coming from the external network and going to another network needs to go through the forward chain.
    
**Policies**

There are three actions which the iptables can perform on the traffic

    ACCEPT
    DROP
    REJECT

**Basic UFW commands**

```bash
sudo ufw status
```
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```
```bash
sudo ufw disable
```
```bash
sudo ufw app list
```

```bash
sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.100
```
**Bloc Subnet**

sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.0/24
```

**Block Incoming Connections to a Network Interface**
```bash
sudo ufw deny in on eth0 from 203.0.113.100
```
**Block Outgoing SMTP Mail**
